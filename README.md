# joesorensen-xyz-vue
My official website, built on vue-cli to show off my work as a developer and an artist, along other things.

## Project setup
If you want to clone the project and mess around with it, make sure you run ``npm install`` in the project root directory. From there, you can spin up the dev server with ``npm run serve``


## TODO
There's currently quite a bit of stuff that needs to be done on the website, and all of that can be found here!

- [x] Write this TODO list
- [ ] Complete website's footer
- [ ] Add my work as an artist and social media to about
- [ ] Create the "my characters" page
- [ ] Revise the exsisting my work section
- [ ] Add more landing page content
- [ ] Potentially add light mode

# joesorensen-xyz-vue
My official website, built on vue-cli to show off my work as a developer and an artist, along other things.

## Project setup
If you want to clone the project and mess around with it, make sure you run ``npm install`` in the project root directory. From there, you can spin up the dev server with ``npm run serve``

## Credits and special thanks
joesorensen.xyz is built on vue-cli 3 using TypeScript and Tailwind CSS. Asset and image credit goes to the following artists:

* TchuMimi
* Vvlili
* Nyletak Abla (AKA the_most_floof)

Special thanks to my boyfriend Denji for emotional support.
